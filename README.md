## Calculator+-

I ended up using react and tailwindscss. I think it came out pretty nicely so far. I really need to figure out how to implement an ErrorBoundary so that it won't crash when something finnicky happens and I would absolutely love to balance the parentheses automatically like the scientific calculator on google  does it. Otherwise it is pretty smooth and fully functional. It can randomly generate numbers between 0 and 1 and 1 and 10 or 1 and 100. It has hover effects, dark mode, both a tape and answer recall. I spent a lot of time trying to elegantly figure out how to add values to the display. I really like where it is at so far, but i am definitely not done yet!  I would absolutely love to add keyboard functionality also.  

Using much of what you built-in Project 1, create a single page client side calculator application.

### Requirements:

The calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Can handle decimals
Can toggle between negative and positive numbers
Can change a number to a percentage
Can clear the current total
When a user presses equal the sum displays. However, the total is held in memory for additional calculations A scrollable history of calculations will display on the app. The format for the display is:

### EXTRA CREDIT:
The application can toggle between light and dark theme. (The actual colors are up to you, you can use what is in the Figma file or do your own thing.)
