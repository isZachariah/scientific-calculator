## Calculator+-

I built this application using TypeScript, React, Vite, and Tailwindscss. I used the shunting yard algorithm and postfix notation for parsing user input and included a selection of binary and unary operators, PEMDAS, as well as some buttons for easily accessing constants pi and e as well as random floating point numbers, integers between 1 and 10 and 1 and 100. The design of the user interface took a while but I like the way it turned out. It looks good in both light and dark mode and it is easy for the user to determine how to operate the calculator to get their solution. My favorite feature is probably how you can easily select an expression or solution from the history tape and carry on with the calculation. I would love to add keyboard input and self balancing parentheses (the way the scientific calculator on google works). I built a custom hook with useReducer, useState, and useEffect to take in user  input and update the display. With such a variety of buttons acting in different ways I was able to get creative with regular expresions and use minimal code.

Feel free to try out the app on GitHub Pages:
